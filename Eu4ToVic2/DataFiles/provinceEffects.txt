# effects that things have on province stuff

#
# <poptype> = <value>
# increases/decreases population with this job
# NOTE: increasing labourers or farmers has the same effect - the game automatically switches them based on the province RGO
# NOTE: crasftmen and clerks will become artisans if there are no factories in the province
# 
# relative_<poptype> = <value>
# increases/decreases population with this job as a % of total province population - applied after all fixed value pop modifiers are applied
#
# factory = <value>
# Increases the number of factories
#
# <factory type> = <value>
# Increases the number of a specific factory. This value is added to the total factory value first.
